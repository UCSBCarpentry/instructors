January 25-26 De-brief 
* 3 whole lessons ommitted
** did it take too long? No! 
** were we too novice teachers? 
*** it will get a little bit faster with experience, but not much
* objective: teaching based on learners pace vs teacher's pace
** sensitive to maybe the one or two slower learners
** use sticky note! pause more, not just for challenges
** pausing when you see a lot of people needing help
** try think-pair-share
* pick and choose challenges, they are not always useful
* start with fresh new clone
* git - worth teaching?, possibly choosing to focus more on using git in terminal, rather than in rstudio
** katja uses git only in terminal (talk more about paradigm of local vs remote)
** talk more about git ignore
* practice git & rstudio on windows
** familiarize ourself with bash commands on windows
* active learning
** throw easy questions, challenges; esp when it is very silent
** use faster students to help answer questions/challenges
** when people aren't typing when you are typing -- explicitly say start a new line, type with me
* looser schedule - less granuler in spreadsheet, less time constraints
* consider teaching different lessons in workshop - familiarize ourselves with other languages
* understanding our ticks! please be generous with feedback to each other
** more breaks! - understand when you are tired as a teacher
** less longer stretches of Sharon and Mary teaching; hear a different voice
