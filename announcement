Dear Faculty.

The UCSB Library's Interdisciplinary Research Collaboratory is pleased to announce a 2-day Software Carpentry Workshop to be presented on Thursday and Friday, March 21 and 22.  This will be our 3rd workshop of 2019, and we want to extend a special invitation to professors who want an intensive introduction to scientific computing best practices and R Studio. 

Software Carpentry aims to help researchers get their work done in less time and with less pain by teaching them basic research computing skills. This hands-on workshop will cover basic concepts and tools, including command line scripting, version control, and data management.  We will introduce task automation and data visualization with the R statistical programming language. Participants will be encouraged to help one another and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems.

This workshop is targeted at novice users. The only requirement is that you can successfully install and configure the software on your own laptop before arriving at the workshop. We welcome all UCSB researchers and faculty who have an interest in learning todayâ€™s research computing tools.

These workshops are part of the larger Data Science Initiative on campus.  The Library is thrilled to partner with Enterprise Technology Services (ETS), Center for Scientific Computing (CSC), and the department of Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Biology (EEMB) to help present this workshop.

Registration is required and limited to 25. For more information, and a link to the registration form, please see: https://ucsbcarpentry.github.io/2019-03-21-UCSBLibrary/
