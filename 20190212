# Carpentry work session
* re:  Certification.  Sharon has received her certification!  Ian, Greg and Mary are scheduled to checkout on Friday.  Since we haven’t heard back from Tim, and most of us proceeding, I will send him a note and cancel.  Lesson learned:  Jon and Tim both take a couple of days to reply to emails.
* Jon shared the EventBrite identity that we use to track registrations.  If you ever host on your own, feel free to use this EventBrite login.
* We decided against having a spring break workshop because a couple of us want to take it off.  Instead, we will run a 3rd Software Carpentry with R during finals week (March 21-22).  We’re not worried about attracting a crowd, as we know grad students and faculty have few commitments finals week.
* In the spring, we have been asked to do an R and a Python that are aimed at the Center for Information Technology and Society’s graduate students.  There will be 2 follow up workshops that will be presented by a CS faculty student and the rock-star Comm grad student Devin Cornell.  
* We all agree that bringing in an outside trainer for our first Python workshop is a good idea.  We are gong to pursue Ryan Avery in geography.
* We all agreed to Mary’s schedule for next week (Feb 21-22).  (Yay Mary for making it!).  I’ll make sure to take time and force people to take the pre-survey during introductions in order to get our % of feedback up.
