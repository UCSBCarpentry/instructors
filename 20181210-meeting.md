# Winter-Spring Planning, 10 Dec 2018 
## Certification:
  - End of February deadline
  - Steps:
    - Participate in zoom instructor discussion session (this may be deprecated)
    - Make a contribution to a lesson
    - Pick and master a lesson
    - Instructor check-out on Zoom
    - We have asked Tim Dennis to do a dedicated checkout for us, either ftf or zoom

## Advice:
- Katja recommends: 
  - 1-day workshops for starters while we get comfortable.  
  - Simple bash and git lessons are useful.  
  - Run them on Saturdays.
  - Time commitment
- Ben 
  - very supportive.
  - working downtown now.  Can't commit for January/February–has RFP's out.
  - Shared spatial lessons–said there's a better library to use by default.

## Logistics decisions:

  - Concentrate on Git / Bash lessons for instructor checkout
  - External trainers for 3 2-day workshops so we all get floater / co-teacher experience


Let library staff register for first 3 seats?
Keep Frew informed.
