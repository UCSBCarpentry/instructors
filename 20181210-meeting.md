# Winter-Spring Planning, 10 Dec 2018 
## Certification:
  - End of February deadline
  - Steps:
    - Participate in zoom instructor discussion session (this may be deprecated)
    - Make a contribution to a lesson
      - don't forget to report to the certification people about doing this.
    - Pick and master a lesson
    - Instructor check-out on Zoom
    - We have asked Tim Dennis to do a dedicated checkout for us, either ftf or zoom

## Advice:
- Katja recommends: 
  - 1-day workshops for starters while we get comfortable.  
  - Simple bash and git lessons are useful.  
  - Run them on Saturdays.
  - Time commitment
    - prep time is extensive:
      - clone and customize the lesson repo
      - instructor really needs to work through all of the exercises beforehand. be able to do it comfortably.
- Ben 
  - very supportive.
  - working downtown now.  Can't commit for January/February–has RFP's out.
  - Shared spatial lessons–said there's a better library to use by default.

## Logistics decisions:

  - Concentrate on Git / Bash lessons for instructor checkout
  - External trainers for 3 2-day workshops so we all get floater / co-teacher experience
  - Let library staff register for first 3 seats?
  - Keep Frew informed.
  - classrooms 1312 or 1575 by default
  - Thursday-Friday (or other days?) during breaks, summer, or week 1
  - Winter lead instructors:
    - Katja–could do Fri / Sat January 25-26 (week 3)
      - at least 3 of us as floaters?  
      - Mary as secondary instructor?
      - does Katja still want to do a spring aimed at EEMB(?) 
    - paid external?
      - at least 3 of us as floaters
    - Ryan Avery or Julia Lowndes?
      - or co-teach or team with some of us?

 ## Preparing
  - Jon will send doodle poll for Carpentry for 90' sessions.
