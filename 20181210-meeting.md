# Winter-Spring Planning, 10 Dec 2018 
## Certification:
  - End of February deadline
  - Steps:
  
    -- Participate in zoom instructor discussion session (this may be deprecated)
    -- Make a contribution to a lesson
    -- Pick and master a lesson
    -- Instructor check-out on Zoom
    -- We have asked Tim Dennis to do a dedicated checkout for us, either ftf or zoom

## Advice:
- Katja recommends: 
  -- 1-day workshops for starters while we get comfortable.  

Simple bash and git lessons are useful.  
Run them on Saturdays.
Time commitment
