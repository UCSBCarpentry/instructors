# Becoming a certified Carpentry Instructor

The [UCSB Library](https://www.library.ucsb.edu/) and [Enterprise Technology 
Services](https://www.it.ucsb.edu/) maintain a membership to the 
[Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/).  Each year we send a cohort of 
people through the Instructor certification process, which inludes:

* A 2-day, 16 hour training workshop plus some preparatory reading.
* Making an edit to a Carpentry lesson.
* Attending at least one session of a Carpentries discussion group.
* A practical teaching demonstration.

Once you are a certified Instructor, you are able to self-organize Carpentry 
Workshops on your own. The Library's Interdisciplinary Research Collaboratory 
also organizes and hosts about three workshops every quarter. We meet weekly
to plan workshops and work on our coding skills.

Please [contact us](mailto:collaboratory@library.ucsb.edu) if you are interested
in becoming a Carpentry Instructor!
