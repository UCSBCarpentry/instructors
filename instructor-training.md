# Becoming a certified Carpentry Instructor

The [UCSB Library](https://www.library.ucsb.edu/) and [Enterprise Technology 
Services](https://www.it.ucsb.edu/) maintain a membership to the 
[Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/).  Each year we send a cohort of 
people through the Instructor certification process, which includes:

* A 2-day, 16 hour training workshop plus some preparatory reading.
* Making an edit to a Carpentry lesson.
* Attending at least one session of a Carpentries discussion group.
* A practical teaching demonstration.

Once you are a certified Instructor, you are able to self-organize Carpentry 
Workshops on your own. The Library's Interdisciplinary Research Collaboratory 
also organizes and hosts about three workshops every quarter. 

If you choose to participate in our upcoming instructor training: 
* We would expect you to complete the certification process (thereâ€™s are 3 post-training tasks)
* Be listed on the UCSB Carpentry Repo and be helper and an instructor for a Library-organized workshop before the end of next 
  school year 
  Roles include:
  * Inttructor
  * Host/Organizer
  * Lesson Developer 
* Participate in team meetings in the lead up to, and immediately after, workshops in which you participate. Team meetings for 
are Wednesdays from 9:00 - 10:20, and as needed to prepare for workshops.
