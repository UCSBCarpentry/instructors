- Decided we would like to teach Python rather than R over the 12 weeks of Summer 2019

- When teaching weekly need to re-cap/review previous week's lesson.

- What is the motivation for teaching Bash/Command Line interface rather than spending more time on the main tool.... R   or Python??  Carpentries advocates for this but why??

- Reviewed post workshop survey results from May 9-10 workshop on Python

- updated [workshopmanual.md](workshopmanual.md)

- updated [https://ucsbcarpentry.github.io](https://ucsbcarpentry.github.io)
