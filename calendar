Added our own software carpentry calendar (https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=ucsb.edu_vjeppqd6vt4qt6qluom1uknlqk%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FLos_Angeles)
, gave you all permission to edit and manage. You should be able to make changes in the calendar.
I added our January, February and March dates.
I added this calendar to our carpentry page on library webpage (https://www.library.ucsb.edu/software-carpentry). 
I also added link to our home carpentry github page (https://ucsbcarpentry.github.io/) which shows past workshop links and upcoming workshops.

- I would like to add our events to the library events calendar, how do we do this?
